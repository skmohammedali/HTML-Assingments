        <h3>Description of The Battle:</h3>
        <p>
            On Nov. 16, 1532, the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro ambushed the Incan ruler Atahualpa, in Cajamarca,<br/>
            in what is now Peru.The slaughter of thousands of unarmed Incan nobility sparked a long struggle between the Spanish and the Incas.
        <br/>
       
        After months of diplomacy and espionage, Pizarro invited the Incan ruler to come to the great square of Cajamarca. Atahualpa agreed and<br/> 
        brought 80,000 people,with an unarmed inner retinue to show good will. Meanwhile, Pizarro's men hid in the city. 
        A friar from the Spanish side<br/> offered the leader a bible (which Atahualpa did not know how to open) and asked the king to accept
         Christianity. The king refused,<br/> the Spanish barraged the unarmed contingent with gunfire, and Atahualpa was captured and eventually 
         executed.

        <h3>Description of The Battle:</h3>
        <p>
            The siege of Orléans (12 October 1428 – 8 May 1429) was the watershed of the Hundred Years' War between France and England. 
            The siege took place at the pinnacle<br/> of English power during the later stages of the war. The city held strategic and symbolic 
            significance to both sides of the conflict.
        <br/>
        The French won the siege of Orléans, France, in May 1429 largely because of Joan of Arc, a teenage peasant whose visions of God led 
        her to fight in the Hundred Years' War. <br/>The English seemed to be winning their nearly six-month siege of the city; but when St. Joan 
        appeared in the city, rallying the citizenry,<br/> suggesting tactical decisions and participating in battle, the French retook the banks
        of the Loire River and defeated the invaders.<br/> The win boosted the morale of the dispirited French, who had been badly beaten at 
        Agincourt, France, by Henry IV. Many say the battle saved the France from centuries of English rule.

            William the Conqueror. By the end of the bloody, all-day battle, Harold was dead and his forces were destroyed.
        <br/>
        On Oct. 14, 1066, the Norman invader William the Conqueror defeated and killed King Harold II on Senlac Hill near Hastings, England.<br/>
        William the Conqueror held that the former King, Edward the Confessor, had promised him the English throne in 1051.<br/> But on his deathbed,
        Edward changed his mind and tapped nobleman Harold Godwinson instead. William marshaled forces to dispute Harold's claim, <br/>
        defeated the newly minted king, and then went on to London, which surrendered to the Norman invader. King William I was crowned on 
        Christmas Day in 1066. <br/>The battle marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule of England.
