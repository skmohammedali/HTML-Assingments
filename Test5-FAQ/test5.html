    <ol>
        <li> <b> What is your sponsorâ€™s occupation? </b> </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b> Answer: </b> </dt>
        <dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; They want to know if your sponsor is really capable to cover your expenses.So, give the answer accordingly</dd>
    </dl>
    <ol start="2">
        <li> <b> Do you have any brother/sister? </b> </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b> Answer: </b> </dt>
        <dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; If your parents will be your sponsor, then the interviewer wants to know if they would be capable to do so, 
            or they will have to financially support other people too.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ol start="3">
        <li> <b> Have you got any loans? How do you plan on repaying your loan? </b> </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b> Answer: </b> </dt>
        <dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; If you do not have any loans you simply say that you do not. Otherwise, honestly tell the interviewer about 
            the quantum of the loan you have applied for and from where you have received the same.
        <br/>
            You can also say that you will be able to find a good job in your home country upon your graduation and repay the same. 
            Do not suggest by any means that you would be paying off the loan by taking up odd jobs in the US.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ol start="4">
        <li> <b> Do you have relatives or friends currently in the US? </b> </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b> Answer: </b> </dt>
        <dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; Answer honestly. Even if you have some faraway relatives that you only meet every three-four years, tell the 
            consular about them. Or if you have a friend you have only met once or twice, you will have to tell the consular again.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ol start="5">
        <li> <b> Why should you be given a student visa? </b> </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt> <b> Answer: </b> </dt>
        <dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the very last question you will be asked. Try to put forward a strong case of why you should be issued a visa. 
            Try to make a strong point of your case, and be confident. Once again, do not gibberish. Even while answering this question, 
            try to convince the interviewer by giving him the impression you have no plans to remain in the United States and that you will return 
            to your home country for sure.</dd>
